Okay, here is a phased development guide for creating your web-based HTML game "Scorched Warrior," inspired by Scorched Earth, focusing on the prototype requirements: one player vs. AI, generated terrain, programmatic mech drawing, main menu, options (music toggle), and procedural chiptune music, with no external asset loading initially.

This guide breaks down the project into logical steps, building complexity incrementally.

**Core Technologies:**

*   **HTML5:** Structure (the canvas element).
*   **CSS3:** Basic styling (canvas container, maybe initial menu layout).
*   **JavaScript:** Game logic, rendering (Canvas API), procedural generation, procedural music (Web Audio API).
*   **HTML5 Canvas API:** For all drawing.
*   **Web Audio API:** For procedural music generation and playback.

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Canvas Rendering**

*   **Goal:** Get a basic HTML page with a working canvas, set up the JavaScript structure, and draw something simple to confirm everything is working.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Create `index.html` with a `<canvas>` element.
    *   Create a basic CSS file (`style.css`) to style the canvas (e.g., make it fill the window or a specific size). Link it in `index.html`.
    *   Create a JavaScript file (`game.js`). Link it in `index.html` (preferably at the end of `<body>` or using `defer`).
    *   In `game.js`, get a reference to the canvas and its 2D rendering context (`ctx`).
    *   Implement a basic game loop structure (e.g., using `requestAnimationFrame`). This loop will typically call `update()` and `render()` functions.
    *   In the `render()` function, clear the canvas and draw a simple shape (like a rectangle or circle) to confirm rendering.
    *   Add basic event listeners (e.g., for window resize to adjust canvas size).
*   **Output/Milestone:** A blank HTML page with a canvas displaying a dynamically drawn shape that updates via a game loop.

**Phase 2: Procedural Terrain Generation & Drawing**

*   **Goal:** Generate a varying terrain profile programmatically and draw it onto the canvas.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Implement a function to generate terrain data. A simple approach is using a perlin-like noise function or iterating through X coordinates and calculating a Y height based on randomized segments or smoothed random values. The terrain can be represented as an array of Y coordinates for each X column.
    *   Store terrain data (e.g., `terrainHeights = []`).
    *   In the `render()` function, draw the generated terrain using the `lineTo()` and `fill()` methods of the canvas context. Start from the bottom-left, draw up to `terrainHeights[0]`, across following the height data, and back down to the bottom-right.
    *   Ensure the terrain drawing adapts to canvas size.
*   **Output/Milestone:** A canvas displaying a programmatically generated, varying terrain profile.

**Phase 3: Programmatic Mech Robot Drawing & Placement**

*   **Goal:** Create a function to draw a mech robot using basic shapes (rectangles, circles, lines) and place instances on the generated terrain.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Design the basic structure of the mech robot using simple geometric shapes. Consider body, legs, turret, and a simple gun barrel. Remember, no external image assets.
    *   Create a `drawMech(ctx, x, y, angle)` function that takes the canvas context, position (x, y - likely the base center or bottom-center), and potentially a turret/gun angle.
    *   Inside `drawMech`, use `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()` to manage transformations (translation to the mech's position, rotation for the turret/gun).
    *   Use `ctx.fillRect()`, `ctx.strokeRect()`, `ctx.arc()`, `ctx.lineTo()` etc., to draw the mech's parts. Use different `fillStyle` and `strokeStyle` colors.
    *   Place two instances of the mech on the generated terrain: one for the player and one for the AI. Find suitable X positions on the terrain and calculate the correct Y position based on the terrain height at that X.
*   **Output/Milestone:** A canvas showing the procedurally generated terrain with two programmatically drawn mech robots sitting on it.

**Phase 4: Core Artillery Mechanics (Trajectory & Input)**

*   **Goal:** Implement the physics for a projectile's trajectory and allow the player to input angle and power. Visualize the shot.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Define game constants like gravity.
    *   Implement physics simulation for a projectile: Given a starting position, initial velocity (derived from power and angle), calculate its position over time using basic physics equations (or incremental updates within the game loop).
    *   Create variables for player's current angle and power.
    *   Implement input handling (e.g., keyboard arrows for angle, Up/Down for power). Update the player's angle and power variables based on input.
    *   Visualize the potential trajectory: Draw a dotted line representing the projectile's path based on the current angle and power. This helps the player aim.
    *   Add a way to fire (e.g., Spacebar). When fired, create a "projectile" object with its initial state (position, velocity).
    *   In the `update()` loop, if a projectile exists, update its position based on physics.
    *   In the `render()` loop, draw the projectile (a simple circle).
*   **Output/Milestone:** Player can adjust angle/power, see a trajectory line, fire a projectile that flies in a parabola across the screen.

---

**Phase 5: Collision Detection & Terrain Destruction**

*   **Goal:** Detect when the projectile hits the terrain or a mech and implement terrain modification.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Terrain Collision:** In the `update()` loop, check the projectile's position against the `terrainHeights` array. If the projectile's Y position is greater than or equal to the terrain height at its X position, a collision occurred.
    *   **Terrain Destruction:** Upon terrain collision, modify the `terrainHeights` array around the impact point. A simple approach is to lower the terrain heights in a circular radius around the impact point. Redraw the terrain based on the modified array.
    *   **Mech Collision:** Check if the projectile's position is within the bounding box (or a simple circle) of the opponent mech.
    *   Upon collision (either type), remove/deactivate the projectile.
*   **Output/Milestone:** Projectiles impact the terrain, creating craters, and can be detected colliding with the opponent mech (even if no damage is applied yet).

---

**Phase 6: Game State, Turns, & Basic UI**

*   **Goal:** Manage game flow (turns) and display essential information to the player.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Implement a game state variable (e.g., `currentTurn: 'player' | 'ai'`, `gameState: 'aiming' | 'shooting' | 'turn_end'`).
    *   Modify the game loop logic to proceed through states and turns. Input is only active during the player's 'aiming' state. Shooting transitions to 'shooting'. After collision, transition to 'turn_end', then switch `currentTurn`.
    *   Add health variables for player and AI mechs.
    *   In the `render()` function, draw simple UI elements:
        *   Display whose turn it is.
        *   Display current angle and power values.
        *   Draw simple health bars (colored rectangles) above each mech.
*   **Output/Milestone:** The game follows a turn structure (Player -> AI -> Player...). UI shows whose turn it is, current angle/power, and simple health bars.

---

**Phase 7: Basic AI Implementation**

*   **Goal:** Create a simple AI that can take a turn and fire.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   When `currentTurn` is 'ai', implement AI logic.
    *   **Simple AI:** Start with a very basic AI:
        *   Choose a random angle and power within a reasonable range.
        *   Trigger the "fire" action.
    *   **Slightly Better AI (Optional but Recommended):** Have the AI attempt to target the player's current X position. This involves calculating the required angle/power to reach that X, potentially iterating or using physics equations. It might still miss due to terrain or simple calculation.
    *   The AI's turn should also go through 'aiming' (instantly), 'shooting', and 'turn_end' states.
*   **Output/Milestone:** The AI takes its turn, fires a projectile, and the turn switches back to the player.

**Phase 8: Main Menu & Options Structure**

*   **Goal:** Create a main menu and an options screen structure.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Introduce a higher-level game state (`scene: 'menu' | 'game' | 'options'`).
    *   Modify the main game loop to render and update based on the current `scene`.
    *   **Menu Scene:**
        *   Draw "Scorched Warrior" title programmatically.
        *   Draw "New Game" and "Options" button areas (simple rectangles or text).
        *   Implement click detection for these button areas.
        *   Clicking "New Game" changes `scene` to 'game' and initializes a new game state (Phases 2-7 setup).
        *   Clicking "Options" changes `scene` to 'options'.
    *   **Options Scene:**
        *   Draw "Options" title.
        *   Draw "Music: ON/OFF" text/area.
        *   Draw a "Back" button area.
        *   Implement click detection for "Music" and "Back".
        *   Clicking "Back" changes `scene` back to 'menu'.
        *   Clicking "Music" should toggle a global `musicEnabled` flag (though music isn't implemented yet).
*   **Output/Milestone:** A functional main menu and options screen that navigate correctly. "New Game" starts a basic game instance.

---

**Phase 9: Procedural Chiptune Music & Integration**

*   **Goal:** Generate chiptune-like music programmatically using the Web Audio API and integrate it into the game and menus with a toggle.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Research Web Audio API fundamentals: `AudioContext`, `OscillatorNode`, `GainNode`, `createBufferSource`.
    *   Implement a simple procedural music generator. This is a significant task on its own.
        *   Break down chiptune elements: simple waveforms (square, sawtooth, triangle), arpeggios, simple melodies, basic rhythm.
        *   Create functions to generate sequences of notes (frequencies and durations).
        *   Use `OscillatorNode` to create tones.
        *   Use `GainNode` for volume control and simple envelopes (attack/decay).
        *   Schedule notes using the Web Audio API's time system (`context.currentTime`).
    *   Create different music patterns for the menu and the game (can be variations of the same core generator).
    *   Implement global audio control: a master `GainNode` connected to the context's destination.
    *   Start menu music when `scene` becomes 'menu'.
    *   Stop menu music and start game music when `scene` becomes 'game'.
    *   Implement the `musicEnabled` toggle from Phase 8. When toggled, connect/disconnect the master `GainNode` from the context destination, or adjust its gain to 0/1.
*   **Output/Milestone:** Background music plays in the menu and switches to game music when a new game starts. The option toggle correctly mutes/unmutes the music.

**Phase 10: Polish & Refinement**

*   **Goal:** Improve the prototype's look, feel, and basic functionality.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Drawing Refinements:** Make the programmatic drawing of mechs, terrain, UI, etc., look nicer within the "no assets" constraint (e.g., smoother lines, anti-aliasing where possible, better color schemes). Add small details.
    *   **UI Polish:** Improve the layout and appearance of the UI elements (health bars, angle/power display, messages). Use `ctx.fillText()` for text.
    *   **Input Polish:** Make input smoother or add alternative input methods (e.g., clicking and dragging for angle/power).
    *   **Collision Feedback:** Add visual feedback for hits (e.g., a temporary flash on the mech).
    *   **Win/Loss Condition:** Implement checking for 0 health. Display a win/loss message programmatically and transition back to the menu.
    *   **Basic AI Improvement:** If time/skill allows, slightly improve the AI's targeting or add a small amount of randomness to its otherwise perfect aim (if you implemented perfect aim).
    *   **Code Cleanup:** Organize code into functions/objects, add comments.
*   **Output/Milestone:** A more complete and polished prototype demonstrating all core features.
